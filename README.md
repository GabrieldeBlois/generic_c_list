# generic_c_list

This is to use only on list that do not need to be really optimized:
- indeed the dereferences of function pointers for each nodes is really time expensive
- dereferences of data in each node is time expensive too

By the way i'm sorry if the code isn't so commented. As it is to use in my school projects, it has to be compliant with my school's coding style that does not allow in-function comments.

By the time I will rewrite it to optimize it with my own coding style and with plenty comments

Feel free to ask or contact me if you have any suggestions at gabriel.de-blois@epitech.eu
